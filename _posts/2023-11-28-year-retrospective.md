Personal retrospective for 2023.

Learned a LOT. Got completely fullstack.

## Liked

- Web development including SSR, progressive enhancement, etc.
- Implementing UX, styles to match mockups from a dedicated designer. And feel comfortable about it.
- Playwright for UI testing.

## Learned

- Improved my frontend skills, up to the point where I'm fully confident now across the full stack:
  - SSR, progressive enhancement...: remix professionally, svelte personally.
  - CSS.
- Python: to the point where I maintain live backend services we inherited from another team.
- C#, dotnet: existing live backend services in the prevention team.
- CICD: github actions (I was more used to jenkins in the past).

## Loathed

- Company-wide SDLC policy that proved inflexible for some of the apps we maintain, mandating [more environments than needed](/sdlc/2023/06/30/cicd.html). Luckily we didn't have to do too many changes in those.
- C#, and a bit of dotnet in general.
- Lack of support for FP in python.

## Longed for

- More FP. For sure I'd like f# better than c#. I'm happy with a language that at least allows FP (like js/ts), or I'd be game for learning a purely functional one.
- A greenfield project. It's been a few months now since the last one.
