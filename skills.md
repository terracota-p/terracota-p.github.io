## Key aspects

Can do. Can take up any project, at any stage of development, with a holistic approach.

Proven record throughout my career:

- Lead greenfield products and teams from their beginning.
- Brought order and efficiency to existing teams and codebases, even those having issues.
- Improved code, systems, processes.
- Delivered solutions solo or leading one or more teams.
- Full-stack: server, client, mobile.
- Polyglot: experience in many languages, can quickly learn and deliver in any new one.

## Principles

KISS, BDD, TDD, test pyramid, clean code, clean architecture, functional programming, 12factor, agile, continuous improvement, continuous delivery, DDD, keep learning.

## Practices

FP, OOP, definition by example, unit tests, CICD, config externalization, refactor, loosely coupled services, stateless processes, immutability, pure functions, monitoring & alerting, scrum, PR code reviews, trunk-based development, streams, reactive, event-driven...

Fight anti-patterns: DB integration, shared domain logic across microservices, over-engineering.

## Tech

Fullstack: backend, web, mobile (android, fluter).

Languages: js/ts/node, kotlin, flutter, python, c#, java, a bit of go and rust, amd more...

Other tools: jest/mocha/playwright/cypress/cucumber/..., docker, k8s, REST, openapi, jenkins, github actions, terraform, aws, express, react, redux, nextjs, remix, a bit of blockchain...

DBs: sql, nosql - eg: mongodb, mariadb/mysql, postgres...

## Soft

Agile, devops-culture, teamwork, tech-lead.
